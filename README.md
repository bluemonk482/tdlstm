# TDLSTM
This Tensorflow implementation approximates the Target-dependent LSTMs proposed in (Tang et al. 2016).

## Updated
* Randomized search for hyperparameter optimization is now added.
* Hyperopt and Scikit-optimize (can choose from gp_minimize, forest_minimize and gbrt_minimize) for hyperparameter optimization are now added.
* Code updated to tf 1.2
